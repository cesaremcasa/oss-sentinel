3757910394,115702,Transformations - Add field from calculation: add Logic operators to Binary operation,open,"<!-- Please only use this template for submitting feature requests -->

**Why is this needed**:
The “Add field from calculation” transformation supports only mathematical functions, but in many cases it is necessary to create a new field using basic logical operators. For example, creating a field C = 1 if Field A > Field B, and so on.

**What would you like to be added**:
Add logic operators to ""Add field from calculation"" transformation. It could be just extend binary operators with < > == and != operators. 
The closest example is the IF function in MySQL, which many people currently use to implement basic logic at the DataSource layer.

**Who is this feature for?**
Most users rely on a workaround by moving any logic to the data source layer, for example to MySQL or Infinity. 
However, when working with a Prometheus data source — or especially with mixed queries from different data sources such as Prometheus and SQL together — this quickly becomes painful and, in some cases, even impossible. And all that you have left for data processing and aggregation are ""transformations"".

For example, I would like to color table cell A based on the value of table cell B.
This is a simple and commonly requested operation: you need to display some data in one cell, but highlight it based on an additional external condition. The internet has been full of questions about how to do this for more than five years, yet there is still no clear or proper solution.
“Config from query results” could solve this problem. However, if you cannot create an intermediate field based on a logical condition, then “Config from query results” becomes useless for this use case. 

Without logical operations, we are forced to use such a terrible mathematical expression to implement a simple logical function A > B.
flag = max( min( (A - B) / abs(A - B), 1 ), 0 )

3757831515,115699,Text Panel: Use bottom pane for text entry,open,"**Why is this needed**:

The text panel visualization does not utilize a datasource for rendering. Instead, users enter in text in the right side pane, and that text is shown in the visualization. Because of this, there is no bottom pane.

With no bottom pane, we end up with a lot of unused space. The current input for the text panel being on the left means there is only a small window to enter text into, which is non-ideal 


**What would you like to be added**:

We would like the bottom pane to show, but instead of the current datasource selector/query editor and transformation tabs, to include the text box used for inputting into the text panel.

The current location of the text box in the side panel can be removed.

On the Alert Rule Detail → History page the numeric results for each query are rendered with very high precision (many decimal places), which clutters the UI and makes the page harder to read.

3757573109,115696,Alerting: Grafana UI has a broken serialization of time.Duration from Mimir alertmanager datasources,open,"### What happened?

## Summary

The Grafana UI treats Mimir Alertmanager config of `webhook_config.timeout`, which should be a `time.Duration`, as Go int64 object.

## Impact

We can not update Mimir alertmanager config through datasources from Grafana UI which errors out with:

```
error=""yaml: unmarshal errors:\n  line 1: cannot unmarshal !!int `0` into time.Duration\n  line 1: cannot unmarshal !!int `0` into time.Duration""
```

### What did you expect to happen?

Grafana should respect duration as regular expression instead of int.

### Did this work before?

N/A

### How do we reproduce it?

With a Mimir alertmanager config as follows (which should have a `webhook_config.timeout = 0` by default):

3754197155,115674,Snapshots: Editor role on dashboard/folder does not allow creating snapshots,open,"### What happened?

Using Grafana OSS it appears impossible to allow/disallow snapshot creation with any granularity.
If we have a folder X with a dashboard Y, and a user A with Editor/Admin permissions on either X or Y, user A cannot create snapshots on dashboard Y or any other dashboard in folder X. The only way to enable snapshots for the user seems to be designating them Organization Editor, which means they now have access to edit all dashboards of the Organization. For our workflow this basically requires everyone to be Organization Editor, and the whole granular role system becomes pointless.

Creating a separate Organization is also not a viable option because then one would need to create one Org per dashboard to have any granularity, which is too much friction.

### What did you expect to happen?

When a user has Editor permissions on a dashboard, including permissions inherited from parent folder, they should be able to create snapshots.

### Did this work before?

Snapshots worked differently prior to version 11 if I recall correctly, but this is not very relevant.

### How do we reproduce it?

1. Have Grafana 12 with snapshots enabled
2. Create dashboard Y
3. Create user A with Viewer organization permissions
4. Grant Editor or Admin permissions for user A on dashboard Y
5. Login as user A
6. Observe that the ""Share"" button on dashboard Y is missing its ""Snapshot"" option

3754075988,115673,"Geomap panel snaps back to ""inital view” on dashboard refresh - but only with “fit to data” view.",open,"### What happened?

When I use a Geomap panel with “initial view” set to **_coordinates_**, you can zoom and pan around the map once the dashboard has loaded - all good. A dashboard refresh has no affect. This is good.

But if I set the “initial view” to **_fit-to-data_** then on each dashboard refresh the map snaps back to the initial view, which is really annoying if users want to pan around the area after the dashboard has loaded. ""Initial view"" is no longer just the initial view - it's the ""on every refresh"" view.

_**Note**: where I mention _refresh_ here, this is referring to a Grafana Dashboard refresh. not a browser or page refresh._

It seems odd that these two view options give a different user experience.

The **_coordinates_** way is much better.

### What did you expect to happen?

I would expect the map panel Initial View to work the same way, regardless of whether the initial view is set to **_coordinates_** or **_fit-to-data_**.

The initial view should be just that... **just the initial view** when the dashboard loads. The map should not snap back to this view on every refresh.

This doesn't give a great user experience. And asking our users to switch off the refresh on a dashboard before zooming is also not ideal and not a great experience for them.

### Did this work before?

Not sure. I've tried a few versions, and they're all the same. Even in Grafana Play it is the same (see below).

### How do we reproduce it?

The quickest way to reproduce this is with Grafana Play:

1. Open the Geomap example in Grafana Play: https://play.grafana.org/d/panel-geomap/geomap-examples
2. Set the dashboard refresh to 10 seconds (the default is ""off"")
3. Zoom out or pan the map to another area.
4. You will notice here that nothing changes each 10 seconds - the map area stays as you've zoomed / panned. This is OK.
5. **But....**
6. Now edit one of the Geomap panels and change Initial View (in Map View) from ""coordinates"" to ""fit to data"".
7. Go back to the dashboard.
8. Zoom out or pan the map to another area (same as in step 4).
9. The difference now is that every 10 seconds, the map snaps back to the ""initial view"" (in fact they all do because ""share view"" has been enabled in this example dashboard).
10. _As a further example, you can deactivate the ""share view"" option on some panels - and see the different behaviour at the same time in two different panels._

1. Install Grafana 12.3.1
2. Log in as a user who can edit dashboards (Admin in my case).
3. Open any dashboard and click Edit.
4. Try to:
- Add a new panel.
- Delete an existing panel.
- Add or delete rows.

Observed result:
- In 12.3.1, the controls to add or delete panels/rows are missing or do nothing, so the dashboard layout cannot be modified.
- No obvious errors appear in the browser console.

Control test:
- Downgrading the same environment back to 12.3.0 restores normal edit behavior; all the same dashboards and user can add/delete panels and rows again.



### Is the bug inside a dashboard panel?

Yes, it affects the dashboard and panel editing UI.

### Environment (with versions)?

Grafana: 12.3.1 (broken), 12.3.0 (works)
OS: AlmaLinux 10
Browser: Brave, Firefox, Edge, Chrome

**Why is this needed**:

ref: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/82491


**What would you like to be added**:

User Case 1: There are numerous data sources in Grafana currently. Ideally, **a feature is needed to hide these data sources so that they are invisible both when creating a dashboard and using Explore.** This can prevent users from selecting the wrong data source by mistake.

User Case 2: When using Grafana's multi-organization mode, **configure hidden data sources for the insight self-monitoring dashboards of each organization,** without affecting scenarios such as users creating dashboards.

3753350526,115670,Grafana fails to start completely when provisioned alert rule references non-existent receiver,open,"### What happened?

## Summary
When an alert rule is provisioned (e.g., via ConfigMap) that references a contact point/receiver that doesn't exist, Grafana fails to start entirely. This is overly disruptive behavior — a single misconfigured alert rule should not prevent the entire Grafana instance from starting.

## Actual Behavior
Grafana refuses to start with error:
```
level=error msg=""Failed to provision alerting"" error=""alert rules: invalid alert rule\nreceiver MyFancyAlertChannel does not exist""
Error: ✗ invalid service state: Failed, expected: Terminated, failure: invalid service state: Failed, expected: Running
```

## Impact
This behavior is particularly problematic in multi-tenant or platform scenarios where:
- Teams are allowed to define their own alerts via provisioning (GitOps)
- A single team's misconfiguration brings down the shared Grafana instance for everyone
- Recovery requires manual intervention to fix or remove the faulty configuration



### What did you expect to happen?

## Expected Behavior
Grafana should start successfully and either:
- Log a warning/error about the invalid receiver reference
- Disable or skip the misconfigured alert rule
- Fall back to a default receiver

The invalid alert rule should **not** prevent the entire application from starting.

## Suggested Improvement
- Implement graceful degradation: start Grafana but mark invalid alert rules as broken/disabled
- Provide clear visibility in the UI for misconfigured rules
- Consider a ""strict mode"" flag for environments that prefer fail-fast behavior

### Did this work before?

I don't think so.

### How do we reproduce it?

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a contact point via the Grafana UI (e.g., `MyFancyAlertChannel`)
2. Provision an alert rule via ConfigMap/file provisioning that references this UI-created contact point
3. Redeploy/restart Grafana (the UI-created contact point is not persisted in provisioning and is lost)
4. Grafana fails to start

3751156710,115660,Actions should have Dashboard refresh option.,open,"**Why is this needed**:
Dashboard isn't refreshed after Action happen. 


**What would you like to be added**:
Any Action usually results in a data state change; if this new state affects the data displayed on the dashboard, it should be updated.
It would be great if Action section has an optional check box - ""Refresh dashboard"". Dashboard refresh should be triggered after http response received.
Of course, we can rely on automatic periodic dashboard refreshes, but in practice auto-refresh sometimes is disabled or set to a low frequency to reduce the load on the backend or the database in case of heavy queries. Responsive updating dashboard after Action makes the UX obvious and predictable. 
Adding Dashboard Refresh after an Action allows to build full-fledged control panels with actions and displaying the results of these actions.

**Who is this feature for?**
For example, we have a table with monitoring nodes, and an Actions in the cell for each node: ""Server restart"", ""Server stop"", etc. 
If we click the Action, the table should reflect the new state of the node.

3749081858,115655,TraceQL recording rules: inconsistencies between labeling conventions between mimir and tempo cause err-mimir-label-invalid errors,open,"### What happened?

Because tempo has a dot notation convention for labels, and mimir has an underscore convention, when we try to create Traceql recording rule (https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/104289) that includes a label with a dot (or other invalid mimir label character), then the recording rule throws err-mimir-label-invalid.

For example this TraceQL will succeed:

`
{ resource.service.name=""my-most-excellent-service""}  | max_over_time(span:duration) by (name) 
`
However these TraceQL will throw:
`
{ resource.service.name=""my-most-excellent-service""} | max_over_time(span:duration) by (.span.kind)
`
`
{ resource.service.name=""my-most-excellent-service""} | max_over_time(span:duration) by (span:kind)
`





### What did you expect to happen?

I think the most elegant solution here would be for TraceQL to support some kind of label rename at query time, then I could explicitly provide a mimir-safe label name; I didn't find that or similar feature request on the Tempo backlog...  maybe a less elegant solution would be to coerce invalid characters to underscores?  

Any thoughts/advice on the matter will be appreciated, thanks!

1. Create a TraceQL recording rule a la https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/104289

When scrolling vertically in the SQL expression input box, the browser back functionality gets triggered even when you've not reached the left-most position. This is particularly annoying as SQL expressions will have longer rows needing to scroll. More so due to the schema table on the right, halving the width of the input box.

3743556465,115568,Filter by reduction over time,open,"<!-- Please only use this template for submitting feature requests -->

**Why is this needed**:

In this specific case I have a dashboard which monitors statuses of different systems and system utilization by different processes and/or users.

As it is, some of these panels become very cluttered by low utilization processes or similar. Especially the legend but also to the timeseries graphs themselves. I would rather just see the timeseries that might be of interest based on some summary statistic of each timeseries (max, sum or similar).

I could filter each datapoint on some threshold with a binary greater then, but this doesn't really help for small thresholds and for large thresholds it removes information that can be of interest for the timeseries of interest.

**What would you like to be added**:

Either a transform or an operation that filters an entire timeseries/set-of-labels based on some reduction over time. Something like:

`Filter by reduction over time: <Reduction drop down>, <binary relation drop down, i.e. greater than etc.> <threshold value entry>`

**Who is this feature for?**

<img width=""1457"" height=""611"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5cd461-8fa6-4912-905b-95895de86ca7"" />

timeserie visualization with only query with nulls visible:

### What did you expect to happen?

I'd expect a consistent behavior. The correct visualization of the query with nulls is the second image shown and i expect the same visualization even adding other independent queries

### Did this work before?

No idea

### How do we reproduce it?

just import the panel exported below and try to deactivate the visualization of the query without nulls and you obtain the screenshots i posted

### Is the bug inside a dashboard panel?

### What did you expect to happen?

When a silence is recreated, the silence `createdBy` field should be associated with the user who was recreated it.

### Did this work before?

N/A

### How do we reproduce it?

1. `UserA` creates a silence
2. Let the silence expires
3. `UserB` recreates the silence using the `Recreate` button
4. Silence will be assigned to the original creator `UserA`

3741671127,115529,image rendering does not work,open,"### What happened?

Just upgraded grafana to 12.3.1 and found, that image export is not working at all: When clicking on the panel's `Export | Export as image | Generate image` I get immediately the error message: `Failed to generate image
NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`

### What did you expect to happen?

I should see least a request logged by the `./grafana-image-renderer server` running on the same server.

### Did this work before?

Wasn't available before.

### How do we reproduce it?

1. Export
2. Export as image
3. Generate image


### Is the bug inside a dashboard panel?

I guess it might be caused by inappropriate routing. E.g. in the ""Firefox Developer GUI | Network"" I see failed GET and OPTION requests like `http://localhost:3000/grafana/render/d/...` but the URL aka `Origin` used to access grafana is: `http://localhost:9147/grafana/d/...`. So my guess is, that the app uses either wrong hardcoded URLs, or does not use just URL pathes, but calculates by its own URLs in a buggy way by using wrong CGI/server params instead off `HTTP_HOST` for it.

Grafana: 12.3.1

After upgrading from Grafana OSS 11.1.0 to 12.3.0, I am encountering a ""Legacy Storage"" error when accessing specific dashboards or attempting to save changes.

What was expected? Dashboards should migrate seamlessly to the new schema without throwing storage legacy errors.

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade Grafana from 11.1.0 to 12.3.0.

Open a dashboard that was created in the previous version.

Attempt to save or view alert rules.

3738496077,115480,[Feature Request] Native Git Sync support for Multi-Org Architecture & Two-Way Sync Workflow (OSS),open,"Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. Yes, I am facing significant limitations while trying to implement a GitOps workflow in Grafana OSS v12.3.0.

I am trying to establish a workflow where dashboards are synchronized with a GitHub repository. The goal is to allow users to ""push"" changes to a branch, merge via PR, and ""pull"" updates, avoiding overwrites. However, I am encountering a blocking issue regarding Multi-Organization support.

I have multiple Organizations configured in Grafana, each with its own permissions, DataSources, Alerts, and Dashboards. When I attempt to link Grafana with Git for synchronization:

The synchronization logic seems to bind to a single organization context.

When the sync runs for one organization, it deactivates or removes the context/dashboards of the other organizations, effectively making it impossible to manage a multi-org environment via Git Sync.

There is no clear configuration to map specific Git directories or branches to specific Grafana Organization IDs.

Describe the solution you'd like I would like to request native support for Multi-Organization Git Synchronization. The configuration should allow mapping the repository structure to Grafana Organizations.

I have tried standard provisioning, but it is strictly one-way (File -> Grafana) and does not support the user-driven ""Push"" workflow I need. I am currently migrating from v11.1.0 to v12.3.0 hoping for better support, but the single-org limitation persists.

3735874667,115439,Alerting: Support reusable query templates with placeholders in the UI,open,"### **What problem are you trying to solve?**

In Grafana Alerting, alert rules require each team or service to define its own query logic, even when the underlying condition is conceptually the same.

This leads to:
	•	duplicated alert queries across teams,
	•	inconsistencies in how similar alerts are implemented,
	•	high maintenance cost when a common query needs to be updated,
	•	reliance on copying/pasting queries instead of reusing shared definitions.

Grafana currently lacks a first-class mechanism to reuse alert query logic across alert rules.

⸻

### **Important clarification**: this is NOT about dashboard template variables

Several existing issues and discussions focus on supporting dashboard template variables in alert queries.

The following issues and discussions are often referenced in relation to templating in alerting, but they do not fully address the use case described here:
	•	#6557 – “Alerting support for queries using template variables”
	•	#9334 – “Alerting with template variables”
	•	#16681 – “Alerting does not support template variables”
	•	#36110 – “Template variables are not supported in alert queries”
	•	Discussion #39249 – “Allow Template Variables To Be Used in Alert Queries”
	•	#76596 – “Add variable interpolation when creating alert rule from panel”


👉 None of the above propose a UI-level concept of reusable alert query templates with placeholders, defined once and instantiated multiple times with different values.

This proposal addresses a different and more general problem.
⸻

### **Proposed solution**

Introduce Query Templates as a first-class concept in Grafana Alerting.

A query template would:
	•	Define a query once (PromQL, LogQL, etc.)
	•	Contain explicit placeholders (e.g. ${service}, ${namespace}, ${cluster})
	•	Be stored and managed centrally
	•	Be selectable from the Alert Rule UI

When a user selects a query template:
	•	The UI detects placeholders
	•	The UI prompts for values
	•	The alert rule is instantiated from the template + provided values

⸻

Example

`sum by (pod) (
  rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
    namespace=""${namespace}"",
    container!="""",
    pod=~""${service}.*""
  }[5m])
)`



### **Alert rule creation**

The UI prompts for:
	•	namespace: payments
	•	service: checkout

Result:
	•	Consistent alert logic
	•	No query duplication
	•	Easy reuse across services

It could look like something  like this 

<img width=""1536"" height=""1024"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e7b4ca0-05dd-4fda-9a79-7c0de3382576"" />

⸻

Benefits
	•	Reuse of alert logic across teams
	•	Consistency in alert definitions
	•	Lower barrier for teams less familiar with query languages
	•	Centralized ownership of alert patterns
	•	Reduced maintenance cost

This is particularly valuable for common infrastructure alerts, such as:
	•	Kubernetes CPU / memory usage per service
	•	Error rate alerts
	•	Latency SLO alerts
	•	Queue or consumer lag alerts

⸻

Summary

While previous issues focus on enabling dashboard template variables in alert queries, this proposal introduces a different abstraction:
reusable, centrally defined alert query templates with placeholders, instantiated via the alerting UI.

This would significantly improve alert consistency, reuse, and maintainability in Grafana.",nachopv,0,"type/feature-request, type/ux, area/alerting, type/proposal, automated-triage",https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/115439,2025-12-16T18:24:40Z,,neutral,feature_request,medium

Since I updated to 12.3.0 (this change is documented in this issue: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/112184), my provisioned dashboards no longer update when the local files are changed.

There is no supported way to derive threshold values dynamically from query results or datasource fields (e.g., values returned from Elasticsearch).

In use cases where threshold values vary per series or depend on data returned by the query, this limitation prevents accurate visual representation and requires hard-coding values.

It would be very useful if Grafana could support:
● Setting thresholds from query fields or variables.
● Applying per-series threshold values dynamically
Or
● Allowing thresholds to be updated programmatically based on datasource data
● Applying thresholds based on the dashboard variables.

This would greatly improve flexibility for dashboards built on Elasticsearch and similar data sources.

This is exactly the same issue as was mentioned a year ago by #89057. But that one got stale and closed. Sorry for reopening that in this way. It is unfortunate that it got dismissed. The issue was [known to have existed from at least 2018](https://community.grafana.com/t/display-of-64-bits-integers/7162).

FWIW it is not localized to the pg datasource. At least Clickhouse also exhibits the same issue.

### What did you expect to happen?

display the whole precision of 64 bit ints. (bigint?)

### Did this work before?

no

### How do we reproduce it?

1. open a datasource query view (let's use pg as an e.g.)
2. `select 4611686018427387904 :: bigint`
3. witness the missing precision

3729856892,115320,Grafana plugins: GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS not installed when all default drilldown plugins are disabled,closed,"### What happened?

On Grafana 10.3.1 (using helm-chart), 

When configuration 
```yaml
plugins. disable_plugins: 'grafana-pyroscope-app,grafana-metricsdrilldown-app,grafana-lokiexplore-app,grafana-exploretraces-app'
```

Additional plugins configured in GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS are not installed and loaded. (for example, `grafana-opensearch-datasource,grafana-clock-panel`)

### What did you expect to happen?

Plugins (example: `grafana-opensearch-datasource,grafana-clock-panel`) should be loaded even if there is no default drilldown plugin enabled. 

### Did this work before?

It used to work in Grafana 10.1.X. 

### How do we reproduce it?

1. Using Grafana version 10.3.1 (using helm-chart) 
2. Set environment variable GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS='grafana-opensearch-datasource,grafana-clock-panel'
3. Set grafana.ini `plugins. disable_plugins: 'grafana-pyroscope-app,grafana-metricsdrilldown-app,grafana-lokiexplore-app,grafana-exploretraces-app'`
4. Go to plugins pannels and see that opensearch plugin is not installed

Tempo is integrated with Grafana and can perform queries normally. However, when querying, if the time range includes the most recent 30 minutes, the query button in the upper right corner has a high probability of getting stuck in a loading state—that is, the spinning icon in front of the “Run query” button keeps spinning. This issue is especially noticeable when switching between the “Search” and “TraceQL” tabs. If querying data from more than 30 minutes ago, this problem does not occur.
