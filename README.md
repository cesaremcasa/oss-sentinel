## The Problem

Traditional OSS metrics like **Star counts** and **Forks** are lagging indicators. They do not reflect current operational reality, maintenance burden, or developer satisfaction of a project.

**OSS Sentinel** addresses this gap by analyzing the **"heartbeat"** of a repository: its **Issues**. By leveraging NLP to classify sentiment and urgency, we move beyond vanity metrics to actionable insights about project stability and technical debt.

---

## Architecture

The pipeline follows a rigorous **data engineering flow**:

**Ingestion Layer:** Connects to GitHub Search API to fetch raw issue data based on temporal and repository targets.

**Processing Layer:** Uses Pandas to clean, normalize, and flatten nested JSON structures into a structured schema.

**Enrichment Layer:** Employs OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to perform deep semantic classification on every issue: Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative), Category (Bug / Feature / Documentation / Other), Urgency (High / Medium / Low).

**Analytics Layer:** Computes a proprietary Pain Index (Sentiment × Urgency) and generates diagnostic heatmaps.

---

## Findings & Insights

As a **Proof of Concept**, OSS Sentinel analyzed the health of three major Business Intelligence tools (**Apache Superset**, **Grafana**, and **Metabase**) over the last 6 months.

> **Window**: 180 Days | **Sample**: 100 issues/repo

### Health Comparison (Pain Index)

| Repository        | Pain Index | Sentiment Distribution       | High Urgency Rate |
|-------------------|------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Grafana**       | `-1.03`    | Balanced (51% Neg / 12% Pos) | 25%               |
| **Metabase**      | `-1.54`    | Mixed (67% Neg / 7% Pos)     | 41%               |
| **Apache Superset** | `-2.21`  | Critical (87% Neg)           | 53%               |

**Pain Index Formula**: `(-1 to +1) × (Low:1 / Med:2 / High:3)`. Lower is "worse".

### Key Insights

#### **Grafana: The "Safe Bet"**
Exhibits the **lowest "Pain Score"**. While issues exist, they tend to be of medium urgency. The higher positive sentiment ratio indicates a healthier community response to issues.

#### **Apache Superset: The "Trauma Hospital"**
The data reveals a **demanding technical debt load**. The overwhelming negative sentiment (87%) coupled with the highest Urgency rate suggests the project is in a constant state of triage. Adoption requires a strong internal engineering team.

#### **Metabase: The "Tired Middle Ground"**
Sits between the two. High urgency bugs are prevalent, but the community is slightly more positive than Apache, indicating a **resilient but strained** support ecosystem.
